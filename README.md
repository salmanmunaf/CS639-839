# CS639-839
Repository for the Group Project for: Introduction to Blockchain Technologies (CS639/839)

## Summary
The objective of this project was to develop a decentralized roulette game using Ethereum Smart Contracts, with an added focus on using Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to generate randomness in the Roulette spins. Roulette is a game which is played in Casinos all around the world. This was to ensure maximum fairness and low probability of an external party being malicious actors. The game was coded as a smart contract that has been deployed on the Sepolia Ethereum Test blockchain network. Players will be able to participate in the game using SepoliaETH, and the outcome of each spin will be determined by a random number generator imported from the Chainlink VRF Oracle.
